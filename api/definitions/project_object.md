```
{
    "creator": /* Username of the user who created the project */
    "id": /* The project's ID */
    "love_count": /* How many people have clicked the love button on the project's page */
    "remixers_count": /* How many people have remixed the project */
    "thumbnail_url": /* URL to the project's thumbnail */
    "title": /* The project's title */
    "type": "project"
}
```
