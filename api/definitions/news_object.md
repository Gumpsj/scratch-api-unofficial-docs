# News Object

A news object looks like this:

```
{
    "id": /* News entry ID */
    "stamp": /* The timestamp at which the news entry was published */
    "headline": /* The headline string */
    "copy": /* The description string */
    "image": /* The URL to the news icon */
    "url": /* The URL to the complete news entry webpage (usually a forum topic or studio) */
}
```
